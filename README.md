# Unhandled Exception in Dart Async Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous operations: improper exception handling. The provided `fetchData` function attempts to simulate a network request and includes error handling using a try-catch block. However, the current implementation is limited, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and failures that are not easily diagnosed.

The solution provided adds more comprehensive error handling to ensure all potential errors are caught and handled appropriately.  This approach improves the robustness and reliability of the asynchronous operation.
